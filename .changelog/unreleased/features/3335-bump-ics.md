- Bump [ICS](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) to
  [v6.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v6.0.0).
  This release of ICS enables the permissionless creation of consumer chains 
  and allows validators outside the active validator set to opt in to validate 
  on consumer chains.
