### API BREAKING

  [v0.47.10-ics-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.47.10-ics-lsm).
  As compared to [v0.47.10](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.47.10), 
  this special branch of cosmos-sdk has the following API-breaking changes:
  ([\#2967](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2967))
  - Limit the accepted deposit coins for a proposal to the minimum proposal deposit denoms (e.g., `uatom` for Cosmos Hub). ([sdk-#19302](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19302))
  - Add denom check to reject denoms outside of those listed in `MinDeposit`. A new `MinDepositRatio` param is added (with a default value of `0.01`) and now deposits are required to be at least `MinDepositRatio*MinDeposit` to be accepted. ([sdk-#19312](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19312))
  - Disable the `DenomOwners` query. ([sdk-#19266](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19266))
- The consumer CCV genesis state obtained from the provider chain needs to be 
  transformed to be compatible with older versions of consumer chains 
  (see [ICS docs](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/consumer-development/consumer-genesis-transformation)). 
  ([\#2967](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2967))

  This special branch of cosmos-sdk backports a series of fixes for issues found 
  during the [Oak Security audit of SDK 0.47](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Cosmos%20SDK/2024-01-23%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Cosmos%20SDK%20v1.0.pdf).

  - Backport [sdk-#18146](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18146): Add denom check to reject denoms outside of those listed in `MinDeposit`.

Expect for `AfterProposalFailedMinDeposit` and `AfterProposalVotingPeriodEnded` that will log the error and continue. ([sdk-#19305](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19305))
  - Backport [sdk-#18189](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18189): Limit the accepted deposit coins for a proposal to the minimum proposal deposit denoms. ([sdk-#19302](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19302))
