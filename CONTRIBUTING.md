Thank you for considering making contributions to Gaia! üéâüëç

## Overview

Contributing to this repo can mean many things such as participating in
discussion or proposing code changes.
Following the processes outlined in this document will lead to the best
chance of getting changes merged into the codebase.

### Responsibilities of the stewarding team

Gaia has many stakeholders contributing and shaping the project. 
The _Gaia stewarding team_ is composed of Informal Systems developers and 
is responsible for stewarding this project over time.
This means that the stewarding team needs to understand the nature of, 
and agree to maintain, all of the changes that land on `main` or a backport branch. 
It may cost a few days/weeks' worth of time to _submit_ a particular change, 
but _maintaining_ that change over the years has a much higher cost that the stewarding team will bear.

### Ease of reviewing

 The fact that the stewarding team needs to be able to deeply understand the short-,
 medium- and long-term consequences of incoming changes means that changes need
 to be **easy to review**.

 What makes a change easy to review, and more likely to land in an upcoming
 release?

 1. **Each pull request must do _one thing_**. It must be very clear what that
    one thing is when looking at the pull request title, description, and linked
    issues. It must also be very clear what value it ultimately aims to deliver,
    and for which user(s). A single pull request that does multiple things, or
    without a clear articulation of the problem it attempts to solve, may be
    rejected immediately.

 2. **Each pull request must be manageable in size**. 
    Self-contained pull requests that are manageable in size may target `main` directly. 
    Larger contributions though must be structured as a series of smaller pull requests 
    each building upon the previous one, all ideally tracked in a tracking issue 
    (i.e., [an EPIC](#project-board)). 
    These pull requests must target a long-lived feature branch. 
    For details, see the [development procedure guidelines](#development-procedure).
    Poorly structured pull requests may be rejected immediately with a
    request to restructure them.

    **Note**: This does not necessarily apply to documentation-related changes or
    automatically generated code (e.g. generated from Protobuf definitions). But
    automatically generated code changes should occur within separate commits, so
    they are easily distinguishable from manual code changes.

### Workflow

To ensure a smooth workflow for all contributors, a general procedure for contributing has been established.

1. Start by browsing [existing issues](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/discussions). If you are looking for something interesting or if you have something in your mind, there is a chance it had been discussed.
   * Looking for a good place to start contributing? How about checking out some [good first issues](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [bugs](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug)?
2. Determine whether a GitHub issue or discussion is more appropriate for your needs:
   1. If you want to propose something new that requires specification or an additional design, or you would like to change a process, start with a [new discussion](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/discussions/new/choose). With discussions, we can better handle the design process using discussion threads. A discussion usually leads to one or more issues.
   2. If the issue you want addressed is a specific proposal or a bug, then open a [new issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues/new/choose).
   3. Review existing [issues](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues) to find an issue you'd like to help with.
3. Participate in thoughtful discussion on that issue.
4. If you would like to contribute:
   1. Ensure that the proposal has been accepted.
   2. Ensure that nobody else has already begun working on this issue. If they have,
      make sure to contact them to collaborate.
   3. If nobody has been assigned for the issue and you would like to work on it,
      make a comment on the issue to inform the community of your intentions
      to begin work and please wait for an acknowledgement from the stewarding team.
5. To submit your work as a contribution to the repository, follow standard GitHub best practices. 
   See [development procedure guidelines](#development-procedure) below.

**Note:** For very small or trivial issues such as typos, you are not required to open an issue before submitting a PR. 
For complex problems or features, please make sure to open an issue and provide context and problem description. 
PRs opened before adequate design discussion has taken place in a GitHub issue have a high likelihood of being rejected without review.

## Project Board

We use self-organizing principles to coordinate and collaborate across organizations in structured "EPICs" that focus on specific problem domains or architectural components of Gaia. For details, see the [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/projects/28/views/11). 

The developers work in sprints, which are available in a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/projects/28/views/2). 

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

When proposing an architecture decision for Gaia, please start by opening an [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues/new/choose) or a [discussion](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/discussions/new) with a summary of the proposal. Once the proposal has been discussed and there is rough alignment on a high-level approach to the design, you may either start development, or write an ADR.

If your architecture decision is a simple change, you may contribute directly without writing an ADR. However, if you are proposing a significant change, please include a corresponding ADR.

To create an ADR, follow the [template](./docs/architecture/adr-template.md) and [doc](./docs/architecture/README.md). If you would like to see examples of how these are written, please refer to the current [ADRs](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/docs/architecture).

## Development Procedure

`main` must be stable, include only completed features and never fail `make lint`, `make run-tests`, or `make build/install`.

Depending on the scope of the work, we differentiate between self-contained pull requests and long-lived contributions (features).

**Self-contained pull requests**:

* Fork the repo (core developers must create a branch directly in the Gaia repo),
branch from the HEAD of `main`, make some commits, and submit a PR to `main`.
* For developers who are core contributors and are working within the `gaia` repo, follow branch name conventions to ensure clear
ownership of branches: `{moniker}/{issue#}-branch-name`.
* See [Branching Model](#branching-model-and-release) for more details.

**Large contributions**:

* Make sure that a feature branch is created in the repo.
  This will be created by the stewarding team after design discussions. 
  The name convention for the feature branch must be `feat/{issue#}-branch-name`.
  Note that (similar to `main`) all feature branches have branch protection rules and they run the CI.
  Unlike `main`, feature branch may intermittently fail `make lint`, `make run-tests`, or `make build/install`.
* Fork the repo (core developers must create a branch directly in the Gaia repo),
  branch from the HEAD of the feature branch, make some commits, and submit a PR to the feature branch.
  All PRs targeting a feature branch should follow the same guidelines in this document.
* Once the feature is completed, submit a PR from the feature branch targeting `main`. 
  
Be sure to run `make format` before every commit. The easiest way
to do this is have your editor run it for you upon saving a file (most of the editors
will do it anyway using a pre-configured setup of the programming language mode).
A convenience git `pre-commit` hook that runs the formatters automatically
before each commit is available in the `contrib/githooks/` directory.

**Note:** Exceptions to the above guidelines are possible, but only after prior discussions with the stewarding team. 

### Testing

Tests can be executed by running `make run-tests` at the top level of the Gaia repository.
For running the e2e tests, make sure to build the docker images by running `make docker-build-all`.

When testing a function under a variety of different inputs, we prefer to use
[table driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests).
Table driven test error messages should follow the following format
`<desc>, tc #<index>, i #<index>`.
`<desc>` is an optional short description of whats failing, `tc` is the
index within the table of the testcase that is failing, and `i` is when there
is a loop, exactly which iteration of the loop failed.
The idea is you should be able to see the
error message and figure out exactly what failed.
Here is an example check:

```go
<some table>
for tcIndex, tc := range cases {
<some code>
for i := 0; i < tc.numTxsToTest; i++ {
<some code>
require.Equal(t, expectedTx[:32], calculatedTx[:32],
"First 32 bytes of the txs differed. tc #%d, i #%d", tcIndex, i)
```

### Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request:

* synchronize your branch with the latest base branch (i.e., `main` or feature branch) and resolve any arising conflicts, e.g.,
  - either `git fetch origin/main && git merge origin/main`
  - or `git fetch origin/main && git rebase -i origin/main`
* run `make lint`, `make run-tests`, `make build/install` to ensure that all checks and tests pass.

Then:

1. If you have something to show, **start with a `Draft` PR**. It's good to have early validation of your work and we highly recommend this practice. A Draft PR also indicates to the community that the work is in progress.
   Draft PRs also help the stewarding team provide early feedback and ensure the work is in the right direction.
2. When the code is complete, change your PR from `Draft` to `Ready for Review`.
3. Go through the actions for each checkbox present in the PR template description. The PR actions are automatically provided for each new PR.

PRs must have a category prefix that is based on the type of changes being made (for example, `fix`, `feat`,
`refactor`, `docs`, and so on). The [type](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/v3.0.0/index.json) 
must be included in the PR title as a prefix (for example, `fix: <description>`). 
This convention ensures that all changes that are committed to the base branch follow the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
Additionally, **each PR should only address a single issue**.

Pull requests are merged automatically using [`A:automerge` action](https://mergify.io/features/auto-merge).

**Note:** When merging, GitHub will squash commits and rebase on top of the base branch.

### Pull Request Templates

There are three PR templates. The [default template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) contains links to the three templates. Please go the the `Preview` tab and select the appropriate sub-template:

- The [production template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/production.md) is for types `fix`, `feat`, `deps`, and `refactor`. 
- The [docs template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/docs.md) is for documentation changes.
- The [other template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/other.md) is for changes that do not affect production code. 

### Requesting Reviews

In order to accommodate the review process, the author of the PR must complete the author checklist
(from the pull request template)
to the best of their abilities before marking the PR as "Ready for Review". If you would like to
receive early feedback on the PR, open the PR as a "Draft" and leave a comment in the PR indicating
that you would like early feedback and tagging whoever you would like to receive feedback from.

Codeowners are marked automatically as the reviewers.

All PRs require at least two review approvals before they can be merged (one review might be acceptable in
the case of minor changes to [docs](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/docs.md) or [other](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/other.md) changes that do not affect production code). Each PR template has a reviewers checklist that must be completed before the PR can be merged. Each reviewer is responsible
for all checked items unless they have indicated otherwise by leaving their handle next to specific
items. In addition, use the following review explanations:

* `LGTM` without an explicit approval means that the changes look good, but you haven't thoroughly reviewed the reviewer checklist items.
* `Approval` means that you have completed some or all of the reviewer checklist items. If you only reviewed selected items, you must add your handle next to the items that you have reviewed. In addition, follow these guidelines:
    * You must also think through anything which ought to be included but is not
    * You must think through whether any added code could be partially combined (DRYed) with existing code
    * You must think through any potential security issues or incentive-compatibility flaws introduced by the changes
    * Naming must be consistent with conventions and the rest of the codebase
    * Code must live in a reasonable location, considering dependency structures (for example, not importing testing modules in production code, or including example code modules in production code).
    * If you approve the PR, you are responsible for any issues mentioned here and any issues that should have been addressed after thoroughly reviewing the reviewer checklist items in the pull request template.
* If you sat down with the PR submitter and did a pairing review, add this information in the `Approval` or your PR comments.
* If you are only making "surface level" reviews, submit notes as a `comment` review.

### Updating Documentation

If you open a PR in Gaia, it is mandatory to update the relevant documentation in `/docs`.

### Changelog

To manage and generate our changelog, we currently use [unclog](https://github.com/informalsystems/unclog).

Every PR with types `fix`, `feat`, `deps`, and `refactor` should include a file 
`.changelog/unreleased/${section}/[${component}/]${pr-number}-${short-description}.md`,
where:

- `section` is one of 
  `dependencies`, `improvements`, `features`, `bug-fixes`, `state-breaking`, `api-breaking`, 
  and _**if multiple apply, create multiple files**_;
- `pr-number` is the PR number;
- `short-description` is a short (4 to 6 word), hyphen separated description of the change;
- `component` is used for changes that affect one of the components defined in the [config](.changelog/config.toml), e.g., `tests`, `globalfee`.

For examples, see the [.changelog](.changelog) folder.

Use `unclog` to add a changelog entry in `.changelog` (check the [requirements](https://github.com/informalsystems/unclog#requirements) first): 
```bash
# add a general entry
unclog add 
   -i "${pr-number}-${short-description}" 
   -p "${pr-number}" 
   -s "${section}" 
   -m "${description}"

# add a entry to a component 
unclog add 
   -i "${pr-number}-${short-description}" 
   -p "${pr-number}" 
   -c "${component}"
   -s "${section}" 
   -m "${description}"
```
where `${description}` is a detailed description of the changelog entry.

For example, 
```bash
# add an entry for bumping IBC to v4.4.2
unclog add -i "2554-bump-ibc" -p 2554 -s "dependencies" -m "Bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to [v4.4.2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v4.4.2)" 

# add an entry for changing the global fee module;
# note that the entry is added to both state-breaking and api-breaking sections
unclog add -i "2424-params" -p 2424 -c globalfee -s "state-breaking" -m "Add \`bypass-min-fee-msg-types\` and \`maxTotalBypassMinFeeMsgGagUsage\` to globalfee params" 
unclog add -i "2424-params" -p 2424 -c globalfee -s "api-breaking" -m "Add \`bypass-min-fee-msg-types\` and \`maxTotalBypassMinFeeMsgGagUsage\` to globalfee params" 
```

**Note:** Changelog entries should answer the question: "what is important about this
change for users to know?" or "what problem does this solve for users?". It
should not simply be a reiteration of the title of the associated PR, unless the
title of the PR _very_ clearly explains the benefit of a change to a user.

## Dependencies

We use [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage
dependency versions.

The main branch of every Cosmos repository should just build with `go get`,
which means they should be kept up-to-date with their dependencies so we can
get away with telling people they can just `go get` our software.

When dependencies in Gaia's `go.mod` are changed, it is generally accepted practice
to delete `go.sum` and then run `go mod tidy`.

Since some dependencies are not under our control, a third party may break our
build, in which case we can fall back on `go mod tidy -v`.

## Protobuf

We use [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) along with [gogoproto](https://github.com/cosmos/gogoproto) to generate code for use in Gaia.

For deterministic behavior around Protobuf tooling, everything is containerized using Docker. Make sure to have Docker installed on your machine, or head to [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install it.

To generate the protobuf stubs, you can run `make proto-gen`.

## Branching Model and Release

User-facing repos should adhere to the trunk based development branching model: https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com. User branches should start with a user name, example: `{moniker}/{issue#}-branch-name`.

Gaia follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), but with the some deviations to account for state-machine and API breaking changes. See [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md) for details. 

### PR Targeting

Ensure that you base and target your PRs on either `main` or a feature branch.

All complete features and bug fixes must be targeted against `main`. 
Exception is for bug fixes which are only related to a released version. 
In that case, the related bug fix PRs must target against the release branch.

If needed, we will backport a commit from `main` to a release branch with appropriate consideration of versioning.
