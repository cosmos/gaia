# Gaia
Gaia is the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub, built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).  Gaia and other Cosmos Hubs allow fully sovereign blockchains to interact with one another using a protocol called [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/ibc) that enables Inter-Blockchain Communication.

## Archives && Genesis

With each version of the Cosmos Hub, the chain is restarted from a new Genesis state. This version will be used to upgrade `cosmoshub-3` to `cosmoshub-4`. Mainnet is currently running as `cosmoshub-3`. Archives of the state of `cosmoshub-1` and `cosmoshub-2` are available [here](./docs/resources/archives.md).

If you are looking for historical genesis files and other data [`cosmos/launch`](http://github.com/cosmos/launch) is an excellent resource.

## Disambiguation

Gaia is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. Per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.
