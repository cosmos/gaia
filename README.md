The Cosmos Hub is the first of an exploding number of interconnected blockchains that comprise theÂ [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network).

## ðŸ¤” Why should you be interested in the Cosmos Hub

The Cosmos Hub is built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and compiled to a binary called `gaiad` (Gaia Daemon). The Cosmos Hub and other fully sovereign Cosmos SDK blockchains interact with one another using a protocol called [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc) that enables Inter-Blockchain Communication. In order to understand what the Cosmos Hub is you can read this [introductory explanation](https://hub.cosmos.network).

## Documentation

For the most up to date documentation please visit [hub.cosmos.network](https://hub.cosmos.network).

For an overview of the Interchain Stack (the Cosmos SDK, IBC, etc.), as well as examples and exercises to help developers get a quick start, please visit [tutorials.cosmos.network](https://tutorials.cosmos.network).

### Additional resources

**For node operators:** If you're interested in running a node on the current Cosmos Hub, check out the docs to [Join the Cosmos Hub Mainnet](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet).

**For validators:** If you want to participate and help secure the Cosmos Hub and its [consumer chains](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/interchain-security), consider becoming a validator. Information on what a validator is and how to participate as one can be found at the [Validator FAQ](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq). If you're running a validator node on the Cosmos Hub, reach out to a Janitor on the [Cosmos Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/interchain) to join the `#cosmos-hub-validators-verified` channel.

**For delegators:** If you want to secure the Cosmos Hub without running a validator, you can consider becoming a delegator. Information on what a delegator is and how to participate as one can be found at the [Delegator FAQ](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/delegators/delegator-faq).

## Testnet

To participate in or utilize the current Cosmos Hub testnet, take a look at the [cosmos/testnets](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets) repository.

## Archives & Genesis

In the Cosmos Network, chain IDs have a revision number that is incremented on a hard-fork, i.e., when the chain restarts from a new genesis state.
Mainnet is currently running as `cosmoshub-4`.
If you are looking for historical genesis files and other data [`cosmos/mainnet`](http://github.com/cosmos/mainnet) is an excellent resource. 
Snapshots are also available at [cosmos.quicksync.io](https://quicksync.io/networks/cosmos.html).
