This repository hosts `Gaia`, the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Cosmos Hub Mainnet

To run a full-node for the mainnet of the Cosmos Hub, first [install `gaiad`](./docs/installation.md), then follow [the guide](./docs/join-mainnet.md).

For status updates and genesis file, see the [launch repo](https://github.com/cosmos/launch).

## Quick Start

```
make install
```

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos-SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.
