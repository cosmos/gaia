# Gaia

Gaia is the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub, built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).  Gaia and other Cosmos Hubs allow fully sovereign blockchains to interact with one another using a protocol called [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/ibc) that enables Inter-Blockchain Communication.

## Mainnet Full Node Quick Start

This assumes that you're running Linux or MacOS and have installed [Go 1.14+](https://golang.org/dl/).  This guide helps you:

* build and install Gaia
* allow you to name your node
* add seeds to your config file
* download genesis state
* start your node
* use gaiacli to check the status of your node.

Build, Install, and Name your Node:

```bash
# Clone Gaia from the latest release found here: https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases
git clone -b <latest_release> https://github.com/cosmos/gaia
# Enter the folder Gaia was cloned into
cd gaia
# Compile and install Gaia
make install
# Initialize Gaiad in ~/.gaiad and name your node
gaiad init yournodenamehere
```

Add Seeds:

```bash
# Edit config.toml
nano ~/.gaiad/config/config.toml
```

Scroll down to seeds in `config.toml`, and add some of these seeds as a comma-separated list:

```toml

```

Download Genesis, Start your Node, Check your Node Status:

```bash
# Download genesis.json
wget -O $HOME/.gaiad/config/genesis.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/launch/master/genesis.json
# Start Gaiad
gaiad start
# Check your node's status with gaiacli
gaiacli status
```

## Archives

With each version of the Cosmos Hub, the chain is restarted from a new Genesis state.  We are currently on cosmoshub-3.  Archives of the state of cosmoshub-1 and cosmoshub-2 are available [here](./docs/resources/archives.md).

## Disambiguation

Gaia is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. Per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.
