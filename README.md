The Cosmos Hub is the first of an exploding number of interconnected blockchains that comprise the¬†Cosmos Network.

<br/>

## ü§î ‚Äî Why should you be interested in the Cosmos Hub

___

The Cosmos Hub is built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and compiled to a binary called `gaiad` (Gaia Daemon). The Cosmos Hub and other fully sovereign Cosmos SDK blockchains interact with one another using a protocol called [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc) that enables Inter-Blockchain Communication. In order to understand what the Cosmos Hub is you can read this [introductory explanation](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html).

<br/>

## ‚ö° ‚Äî Documentation & Introduction

___

Cosmos Hub is a blockchain network that operates on Proof-of-Stake consensus. You can find an introduction to the Cosmos Hub and how to use the `gaiad` binary as a delegator, validator or node operator as well as how governance on the Cosmos Hub works in the [documentation](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html).

Alternatively, whether you're new to blockchain technology or interested in getting involved, the Cosmos Network [Course](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/0-welcome/) will guide you through everything. The course walks you through the basics of blockchain technology, to staking, setting up your own node, and beyond.

<br/>

## üë§¬†‚Äî Node Operators

___
If you're interested in running a node on the current Cosmos Hub, check out the docs to [Join the Cosmos Hub Mainnet](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/hub-tutorials/join-mainnet.md).

<br/>

## üó£Ô∏è¬†‚Äî Validators

___

If you want to participate and help secure Cosmos Hub, check out becoming a validator. Information on what a validator is and how to participate as one can be found at the [Validator FAQ](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#). If you're running a validator node on the Cosmos Hub, reach out to a Janitor on the [Cosmos Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to join the `#cosmos-hub-validators-verified` channel.

<br/>

## üë•¬†‚Äî Delegators

___

If you still want to participate on the Cosmos Hub, check out becoming a delegator. Information on what a delegator is and how to participate as one can be found at the [Delegator FAQ](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/delegators/delegator-faq.html).

<br/>

## üë• ‚Äî Testnet

___

To participate in or utilize the current Cosmos Hub testnet, take a look at the [cosmos/testnets](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets) repository. This testnet is for the Theta Upgrade expected in Q1 2022. For future upgrades of the Cosmos Hub take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md).

<br/>

## üåê¬†‚Äî Roadmap

___

For an overview of upcoming changes to the Cosmos Hub take a look at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md).

<br/>

## üóÑÔ∏è ‚Äî Archives & Genesis

___

With each version of the Cosmos Hub, the chain is restarted from a new Genesis state.
Mainnet is currently running as `cosmoshub-4`. Archives of the state of `cosmoshub-1`, `cosmoshub-2`, and `cosmoshub-3` are available [here](./docs/resources/archives.md).

If you are looking for historical genesis files and other data [`cosmos/mainnet`](http://github.com/cosmos/mainnet) is an excellent resource. Snapshots are also available at [cosmos.quicksync.io](https://cosmos.quicksync.io).
