# Cosmos Hub (Gaia)
![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*DHtmSfS_Efvuq8n2LAnhkA.png)

The Cosmos Hub is built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and to build a binary called `gaiad` (Gaia Daemon). The Cosmos Hub and other fully sovereign Cosmos SDK blockchains interact with one another using a protocol called [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc) that enables Inter-Blockchain Communication. In order to understand what the Cosmos Hub is you can read this [introductory explanation](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html).

## Documentation & Introduction
You can find an introduction to the Cosmos Hub and how to use gaia as a delegator, validator or node operator as well as how governance on the Cosmos Hub works in the [documentation](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html). 

## Node Operators
If you're interested in running a node on the current Cosmos Hub, check out the docs to [Join the Cosmos Hub Mainnet](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/join-mainnet.md).

## Validators

If you're running a validator node on the Cosmos Hub, reach out to a Janitor on the [Cosmos Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to join the `#validators-verified` channel.

## Testnet

To participate in or utilize the current Cosmos Hub testnet that upgrades `cosmoshub-4` from gaia v5.0.x to gaia v6.0.x, take a look at the [vega-testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test) repository. This testnet is for the Vega Upgrade expected in Q4 2021. For future upgrades of the Cosmos Hub take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md).

## Roadmap

For an overview of upcoming changes to the Cosmos Hub take a look at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md).

## Archives & Genesis

With each version of the Cosmos Hub, the chain is restarted from a new Genesis state. 
Mainnet is currently running as `cosmoshub-4`. Archives of the state of `cosmoshub-1`, `cosmoshub-2`, and `cosmoshub-3` are available [here](./docs/resources/archives.md).

If you are looking for historical genesis files and other data [`cosmos/mainnet`](http://github.com/cosmos/mainnet) is an excellent resource. Snapshots are also available at [cosmos.quicksync.io](https://cosmos.quicksync.io).
