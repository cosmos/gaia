## üöÄ Highlights

This releases adds several features made possible by the upgrade to Cosmos SDK v0.47:

- The [IBC rate limit module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) prevents massive inflows or outflows of IBC tokens in a short time frame to add an extra layer of protection on IBC transfers.
- The [ICA controller sub-module](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v7/apps/interchain-accounts/overview) enables Hub users to perform actions on other chains using their Hub accounts. 
- The [IBC fee middleware](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v7/middleware/ics29-fee/overview) enables creating IBC channels with in-protocol incentivization for relayers. 

This release also bumps ICS to [v4.1.0-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.1.0-lsm), which introduces [ICS epochs](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-014-epochs) to reduce the relaying cost for ICS.
