As this release replaces the [v15.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v15.0.0) release, please check out the release notes for all the highlights. 

In addition, this release bumps Packet Forward Middleware to `v7.1.3-0.20240228213828-cce7f56d000b`, which contains the same fix as the one introduced by the [v14.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v14.2.0) emergency release. It also fixes a series of escrow accounts by minting and transfering the missing assets to reach parity with counterparty chain supply.
