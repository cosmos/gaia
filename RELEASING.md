# Releasing

This document outlines the release process for <https://github.com/cosmos/gaia>. We use [Long-Lived Version Branch Approach](x) on a `main` branch and a `release` branch.

We follow [Semver](https://semver.org/) in that any patch releases are non-breaking changes. It's important to note, that breaking changes in a Blockchain context include non-determinism. So if a code change is backwards compatible, it may still impact the amount of gas needed to execute an action, which means the change is in fact breaking as it results in a different apphash after the code is executed. It's important for non-breaking changes to be possible to be used on the live network prior to the release.

Each major release will have a release branch and patch releases will be tagged on this branch. No patched release has its own branch. (This branch strategy only applies to `v7` and later releases.)

## Long-Lived Version Branch Approach

In the Gaia repo, there are two categories of long-lived branches:

### Branch: `main`

The `main` branch should be targeted for PRs that contain a bug-fix/feature/improvement that will be included for the next release.

### Branch: `release`

There are multiple long-lived branches with the `release/` prefix. Each release series follows the format `release/vn.0.x`, e.g. `release/v7.0.x`. The branch `release/vn.0.x` should point to the most updated `vn` release, e.g. `release/v5.0.x` should be the same as `release/v5.0.8` if that's the latest `v5.0` release.

## Other Branches

### branches for the next release

Other feature/fix branches targeting at `main` contain commits preparing for the next release. When the `release-prepare-branch` is ready for next release, add label `A:backport/vn.0.x` to the PR of `release-prepare-branch` against `main`, then the mergifybot will create a new PR of `mergify/bp/release/vn.0.x`  against `Release/vn.0.x`.

### branches for the backport release

If the feature/fix branches are for a backport release, `main` branch already contains the commits for the next major release  `vn`, the feature/fix branch's PR should target at `Release/vn-1` rather than `main`.

## Release Procedure

### Checks and tests

Before merge and release, the following tests checks need to be conducted:

- check the `replace` line in `go.mod`, check all the versions in `go.mod` are correct.
- run tests and simulations by `make run-tests`.
- test version compatibilities for minor releases.

### Major and minor Release

For a new major release `n`, checkout `release/vn.0.x` from `main`. Merge or use mergify to merge the commits to `release/vn.0.x`, and tag the version.
For minor release. Merge or use mergify to merge the commits to `release/vn.0.x`, and tag the version.

Usually the first release on the `release/vn.0.x` is a release candidate.

#### example of releasing `v8.0.0-rc0`

1. checkout `release/v8.0.x` off `main`
1. get the `v8-prepare-branch` ready including CHANGELOG.md, create a PR to merge `v8-prepare-branch` to `main`, label this PR `A:backport/v8.0.x`.
1. after merge  `v8-prepare-branch` to `main`, mergifybot will create a new PR of  `mergify/bp/release/v8.0.x` to `release/v8.0.x`. Check the PR, and merge this PR.
1. checkout  `release/v8.0.x` and tag `v8.0.0-rc0`.

#### example of releasing `v8.0.0`

1. get the `v800-prepare-branch` ready including CHANGELOG.md, create a PR to merge `v800-prepare-branch` to `main`, label this PR `A:backport/v8.0.x`.
1. after merge  `v800-prepare-branch` to `main`, mergifybot will create a new PR of  `mergify/bp/release/v8.0.x` to `release/v8.0.x`. Check the PR, and merge this PR.
1. checkout  `release/v8.0.x` and tag `v8.0.0`.

#### example of releasing `v8.0.1`

1. get the `v801-prepare-branch`(off `main`) ready including CHANGELOG.md, create a PR to merge `v801-prepare-branch` to `main`, label this PR `A:backport/v8.0.x`.
1. after merge  `v801-prepare-branch` to `main`, mergifybot will create a new PR of  `mergify/bp/release/v8.0.x` to `release/v8.0.x`. Check the PR, and merge this PR.
1. checkout  `release/v8.0.x` and tag `v8.0.1`.

### backport release

For a backport release, checkout a new branch from the right release branch, for example, `release/vn-1.0.x`. Commits to this new branch and merge into `release/vn-1.0.x`, tag the backport version from `release/vn-1.0.x`.

#### example of backport release `v7.0.5`

assume main branch is at `v8`.

1. checkout `v705-prepare-branch` off `release/v7.0.x`, get the backport changes ready including CHANGELOG.md on `v705-prepare-branch`.
1. create a PR to merge `v705-prepare-branch` to `release/v7.0.x`, and merge.
1. checkout `release/v7.0.x`  tag `v7.0.5`.

### Test building artifacts

Before tagging the version, please test the building releasing artifacts by

```bash
make distclean build-reproducible
```

The above command will generate a directory
`gaia/artifacts` with different os and architecture binaries. If the above command runs sucessfully, delete the directory `rm -r gaia/artifacts`.

### Tagging

The following steps are the default for tagging a specific branch commit (usually on a branch labeled `release/vX.X.X`):

1. Ensure you have checked out the commit you wish to tag
1. `git pull --tags --dry-run`
1. `git pull --tags`
1. `git tag -s v3.0.1 -m 'Release v3.0.1'`
   1. optional, add the `-s` tag to create a signed commit using your PGP key (which should be added to github beforehand)
1. `git push --tags --dry-run`
1. `git push --tags`

To re-create a tag:

1. `git tag -d v4.0.0` to delete a tag locally
1. `git push --delete origin v4.0.0`, to push the deletion to the remote
1. Proceed with the above steps to create a tag

To tag and build without a public release (e.g., as part of a timed security release):

1. Follow the steps above for tagging locally, but do not push the tags to the repository.
1. After adding the tag locally, you can build the binary, e.g., `make build-reproducible`.
1. To finalize the release, push the local tags, create a release based off the newly pushed tag, and attach the binaries.

### Release notes

Ensure you run the reproducible build in order to generate sha256 hashes and platform binaries;
these artifacts should be included in the release.

```bash
make distclean build-reproducible
```

This runs the docker image [tendermintdev/rbuilder](https://hub.docker.com/r/tendermintdev/rbuilder) with a copy of the [rbuilder](https://github.com/tendermint/images/tree/master/rbuilder) docker file.

Then use the following release text template:

# Gaia v4.0.0 Release Notes

Note, that this specific release will be updated with a newer changelog, and the below hashes and binaries will also be updated.

This release includes bug fixes for prop29, as well as additional support for IBC and Ledger signing.

As there is a breaking change from Gaia v3, the Gaia module has been incremented to v4.

See the [Cosmos SDK v0.41.0 Release](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.41.0) for details.

# Major Release Maintenance

Major Release series continue to receive bug fixes (released as a Patch Release) until they reach End Of Life. Major Release series are maintained in compliance with the Stable Release Policy as described in this document. Note: not every Major Release is denoted as a stable release.

Only the following major release series have a stable release status:

v7 Theta is supported until v9 Lambda. A fairly strict **bugfix-only** rule applies to pull requests that are requested to be included into a stable point-release.

v6 Vega is supported until v8 Rho. A fairly strict **bugfix-only** rule applies to pull requests that are requested to be included into a stable point-release.

v5 Delta is supported until v7 Theta. A fairly strict **bugfix-only** rule applies to pull requests that are requested to be included into a stable point-release.

After two releases, a supported version will be transitioned to unsupported and will be deemed EOL with no further updates.

# Stable Release Policy

The intention of the Stable Release Policy is to ensure that all major release series that are not EOL, are maintained with the following categories of fixes:

- Tooling improvements (including code formatting, linting, static analysis and updates to testing frameworks)
- Performance enhancements for running archival and synching nodes
- Test and benchmarking suites, ensuring that fixes are sound and there are no performance regressions
- Library updates including point releases for core libraries such as IBC-Go, Cosmos SDK, CometBFT and other dependencies
- General maintenance improvements, that are deemed necessary by the stewarding team, that help align different releases and reduce the workload on the stewarding team
- Security fixes

Issues that are likely excluded, are any issues that impact operating a block producing network.
