# Upgrade Gaia from v17.1.0 to v17.2.0

## This is a coordinated upgrade. IT IS CONSENSUS BREAKING, so please apply the fix only on height 20740970.

### Release Details
* https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v17.2.0
* Chain upgrade height : `20740970`. Exact upgrade time can be checked [here](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/block/20740970).
* Go version has been frozen at `1.21`. If you are going to build `gaiad` binary from source, make sure you are using the right GO version!

# Performing the co-ordinated upgrade

This co-ordinated upgrades requires validators to stop their validators at `halt-height`, switch their binary to `v17.2.0` and restart their nodes with the new version.

The exact sequence of steps depends on your configuration. Please take care to modify your configuration appropriately if your setup is not included in the instructions.

# Manual steps

## Step 1: Configure `halt-height` using v17.1.0 and restart the node.

This upgrade requires `gaiad` halting execution at a pre-selected `halt-height`. Failing to stop at `halt-height` may cause a consensus failure during chain execution at a later time.

There are two mutually exclusive options for this stage:

### Option 1: Set the halt height by modifying `app.toml`

* Stop the gaiad process.

* Edit the application configuration file at `~/.gaia/config/app.toml` so that `halt-height` reflects the upgrade plan:

```toml
# Note: Commitment of state will be attempted on the corresponding block.
halt-height = 20740970
```
* restart gaiad process

* Wait for the upgrade height and confirm that the node has halted

### Option 2: Restart the `gaiad` binary with command line flags

* Stop the gaiad process.

* Do not modify `app.toml`. Restart the `gaiad` process with the flag `--halt-height`:
```shell
gaiad start --halt-height 20740970
```

* Wait for the upgrade height and confirm that the node has halted

Upon reaching the `halt-height` you need to replace the `v17.1.0` gaiad binary with the new `gaiad v17.2.0` binary and remove the `halt-height` constraint.
Depending on your setup, you may need to set `halt-height = 0` in your `app.toml` before resuming operations.
```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cosmos/gaia.git
```

## Step 2: Build and start the v17.2.0 binary

### Remember to revert `gaiad` configurations
* Reset `halt-height = 0` option in the `app.toml` or
* Remove it from start parameters of the gaiad binary before restarting the node

We recommend you perform a backup of your data directory before switching to `v17.2.0`.

```shell
cd $HOME/gaia
git pull
git fetch --tags
git checkout v17.2.0
make install

# verify install
gaiad version
# v17.2.0
```

```shell
gaiad start # starts the v17.2.0 node
```

# Cosmovisor steps

## Prerequisite: Alter systemd service configuration

Disable automatic restart of the node service. To do so please alter your `gaiad.service` file configuration and set appropriate lines to following values.

```
Restart=no 

Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=false"
```

After that you will need to run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to apply changes in the service configuration.

There is no need to restart the node yet; these changes will get applied during the node restart in the next step.

## Setup Cosmovisor
### Create the updated gaiad binary of v17.2.0

### Remember to revert `gaiad` configurations
* Reset `halt-height = 0` option in the `app.toml` or
* Remove it from start parameters of the gaiad binary before starting the node

#### Go to gaiad directory if present else clone the repository

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cosmos/gaia.git
```

#### Follow these steps if gaiad repo already present

```shell
   cd $HOME/gaia
   git pull
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v17.2.0
   make install
```

#### Check the new gaiad version, verify the latest commit hash
```shell
   $ gaiad version --long
   name: gaiad
   server_name: gaiad
   version: 17.2.0
   commit: <commit-hash>
   ...
```

#### Or check checksum of the binary if you decided to download it

Checksums can be found on the official release page:
* https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v17.2.0

The checksums file is located in the `Assets` section:
* e.g. [SHA256SUMS-v17.2.0.txt](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v17.2.0/SHA256SUMS-v17.2.0.txt)

```shell
$ shasum -a 256 gaiad-v17.2.0-linux-amd64
<checksum>  gaiad-v17.2.0-linux-amd64
```

### Copy the new gaiad (v17.2.0) binary to cosmovisor current directory
```shell
   cp $GOPATH/bin/gaiad ~/.gaiad/cosmovisor/current/bin
```

### Restore service file settings

If you are using a service file, restore the previous `Restart` settings in your service file: 
```
Restart=On-failure 
```
Reload the service control `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

# Revert `gaiad` configurations

Depending on which path you chose for Step 1, either:

* Reset `halt-height = 0` option in the `app.toml` or
* Remove it from start parameters of the gaiad binary and start node again
