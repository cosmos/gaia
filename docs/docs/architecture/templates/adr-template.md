> The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.

## Decision

> This section explains all of the details of the proposed solution, including implementation details.
It should also describe affects / corollary items that may need to be changed as a part of this.
If the proposed change will be large, please also indicate a way to do the change to maximize ease of review.
(e.g. the optimal split of things to do between separate PR's)
