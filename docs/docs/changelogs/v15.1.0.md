# Important changes
Changes are outlined compared to `gaiad <= v14.x`

## Behaviour changes

Starting `v15.1.0` all users must have at least `1 ATOM` staked in order to cast a vote on a governance proposal.

Votes from accounts whose staked amounts are `< 1 ATOM` will be rejected.

##  REST/RPC Changes

### DenomOwners

The `DenomOwners` query is not supported on the Cosmos Hub chain.
* querying `<RPC_ADDR>.cosmos/bank/v1beta1/denom_owners/{denom}` always returns an empty result.


### Querying latest block

`curl <RPC>/blocks/latest` no longer works and returns `{"code":12,"message":"Not Implemented","details":[]}`

The endpoint was moved to: `<RPC>/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest`


# CLI Changes

## Genesis commands

`gaiad` no longer uses a custom genesis commands and instead relies on the commands defined in the [x/genutil module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/modules/genutil).

These queries no longer work:
```shell
gaiad gentx
gaiad collect-gentx
gaiad validate-genesis
gaiad add-genesis-account
```

Use the `genesis` subcommands instead:
```shell
gaiad genesis gentx
gaiad genesis collect-gentx
gaiad genesis validate-genesis
gaiad genesis add-genesis-account
gaiad genesis migrate
```

## Governance commands

Governance commands are aligned with cosmos-sdk v0.47.x [x/gov module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/modules/gov).

### submit-legacy-proposal

Some proposal types can be submitted using the `gaiad tx gov submit-legacy-proposal` command:
```sh
gaiad tx gov submit-legacy-proposal

Available Commands:
  cancel-software-upgrade Cancel the current software upgrade proposal
  change-reward-denoms    Submit a change reward denoms proposal
  consumer-addition       Submit a consumer addition proposal
  consumer-removal        Submit a consumer chain removal proposal
  ibc-upgrade             Submit an IBC upgrade proposal
  param-change            Submit a parameter change proposal
  software-upgrade        Submit a software upgrade proposal
  update-client           Submit an update IBC client proposal
```

Most cosmos-sdk modules no longer allow their parameters to be upgraded using a `param-change` proposal. Use the corresponding `MsgUpgradeParams` message instead and create a JSON file proposal using `draft-proposal` (listed below).

List of proposals available for submission via `submit-legacy-proposal` will be further decreased in subsequent releases.

More information is available in cosmos-sdk [x/gov docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/modules/gov#submit-legacy-proposal).

### draft-proposal

`gaiad tx gov draft-proposal` command is available. You can use this command to create a draft proposal in JSON format.
* more information is available in the cosmos-sdk [x/gov docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/modules/gov#draft-proposal)

### submit-proposal 

`gaiad tx gov submit-proposal` command is available. Use `draft-proposal` (listed above) to create a proposal JSON and submit it as a transaction.

More information is available in cosmos-sdk [x/gov docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/modules/gov#submit-proposal)
