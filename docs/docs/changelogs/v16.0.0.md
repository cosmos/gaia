# Important changes

This version enables relayer incentivization for newly created IBC channels, adds ICA controller functionality and imposes limits on the amount of outgoing ATOM IBC transfers.

With the upgrade of the ICS provider module, the amount of relayer traffic gets significantly reduced due to the introduction of epochs. With epochs, the ICS protocol aggregates validator set updates and sends them every 600 blocks (1 packet/hour) instead of every block. This feature is intended to reduce relayer costs and encourage relayer participation.
