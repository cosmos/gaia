The Cosmos Hub is a public Proof-of-Stake chain that uses ATOM as its native staking token. It is the first blockchain launched in the Cosmos Network and developed using the [cosmos-sdk](https://docs.cosmos.network/) development framework and [ibc-go](https://ibc.cosmos.network/).

Cosmos hub is also the first security aggregation platform that leverages the [interchain-security](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/) protocol ([ICS-28](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation)) to facilitate the launch of cosmos-sdk blockchain projects.


:::tip
Interchain security features deployed on the Cosmos Hub blockchain allow anyone to launch a blockchain using a subset, or even the entire validator set of the Cosmos Hub blockchain.
