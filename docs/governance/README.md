# Governance Overview

The Cosmos Hub ("Gaia") has an on-chain governance mechanism for [signaling](./proposal-types/text-prop.md), changing [consensus parameters](./proposal-types/param-change.md), and spending [funds from the community pool](./proposal-types/community-pool-spend.md). 

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain.


## Community

Cosmos governance is driven by the Cosmos community, and much of the documentation in this repo was funded by the community fund itself in
[Proposal 23](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/23) and [Proposal 63](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/63).
Governance discussions happens in a number of places moderated by diverse community members, including:

- [Forum](http://forum.cosmos.network/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cosmosnetwork)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CosmosGov)
- [Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork)
- anywhere else you might interact with members of the Cosmos community!
