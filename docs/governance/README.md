# Governance Overview

The Cosmos Hub ("Gaia") has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing
text proposals,
changing [consensus parameters](./params-change),
and spending [funds from the community pool](./community-pool-spend).

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals
and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain.
It also provides a place for collaborating on draft proposals in plain text on Github.

If you'd like to draft a proposal, start [here](./best-practices.md).
See the contents below for more background on the governance system,
the different types of proposals, and how to submit one.

community members, including:
