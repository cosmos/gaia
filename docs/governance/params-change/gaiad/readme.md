# gaiad - The Command Line Application for Accessing the Cosmos Hub

## Why use a command line application?
If you're not technically inclined, command line applications are difficult to compile from source, and they're not user-friendly. Why use `gaiad`?

Depending upon what you're doing, there are security risks associated with using executables that somebody else has compiled. While unlikely, using someone else's application may put your funds at risk. `gaiad` is the most direct way to interact with the Cosmos Hub, which means bypassing less reliable or less secure methods.

I've found other documentation either missing, outdated, or insufficient, so my aim is to enable you to compile and operate `gaiad` without being technically-inclined.
