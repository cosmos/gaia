# Keys

See the [Tendermint specification](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/docs/spec/blockchain/encoding.md#public-key-cryptography) for how we work with keys.

See `gaiacli keys --help`.

Also see the [testnet
tutorial](./join-testnet).

TODO: cleanup the UX and document this properly
