# The Cosmos Hub Roadmap

This Cosmos Hub roadmap serves as a reference for the current planned features of upcoming releases. For past releases, please see the following [document](./README.md).

The Cosmos Hub is decentralized and other teams contribute to it as well.

The Informal Systems roadmap can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsA7WstAVz9kHfLeaBAUYo0cFNKcdkwnfDPP3xKzN4I/edit#heading=h.2hlqd6ar7xmu). Other teams also contribute actively to the Hub, but that information lives in other repos or project boards.
