The intention was to stop random denominations from entering fee collections and to reduce the time validators take to check a long list of transaction fees. To address scenarios where no fee payment is required but the denominations for volunteered paid fees are still restricted, the zero coins was introduced to serve as a means of limiting the denoms. Nevertheless, the initial version of the globalfee module had some issues:  In the globalfee module, several Cosmos SDK coins methods were redefined because of the allowance of zero-value coins in the MinimumGasPricesParam. The MinimumGasPricesParam is of sdk.DecCoins type. In the Cosmos SDK, sdk.DecCoins are sanitized to remove zero-value coins. As a result, several methods from sdk.Coins were redefined in the Gaia fee antehandler. BypassMinFeeMsgTypes exists in app.toml, which means each node can define its own value. Thus, it's not clear whether a transaction containing bypass-messages will be exempted from paying a fee. The fee check logic is only executed in CheckTx. This could enable malicious validators to change the fee check code and propose transactions that do not meet the fee requirement.

The allowance of zero coins in the MinimumGasPricesParam within the globalfee module implies that CombinedFeeRequirement(globalFees, localFees) also permits zero coins. Therefore, the CombinedFeeRequirement doesn't meet the requirements of certain sdk.Coins methods. For instance, the DenomsSubsetOf method requires coins that do not contain zero coins.

In the check of feeCoinsNonZeroDenom against nonZeroCoinFeesReq, the Cosmos SDK coins' methods can be used since zero coins are removed from the nonZeroCoinFeesReq, while in the check feeCoinsZeroDenom against zeroCoinFeesDenomReq, only denoms need to be checked.  Checking feeCoinsNonZeroDenom against nonZeroCoinFeesReq:  \tif !feeCoinsNonZeroDenom.IsAnyGTE(nonZeroCoinFeesReq) { return ctx, sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInsufficientFee, &quot;insufficient fees; got: %s required: %s&quot;, feeCoins.String(), feeRequired.String()) }   Here is an example of how the coins split and checked in fee antehandler:  assumption:  globalfee=[1photon, 0uatom, 1stake] and local min-gas-prices=[0.5stake]  fee requirement:  combinedFeeRequirement=[1photon, 0uatom, 1stake]  split fee requirement:  the combinedFeeRequirement into nonZeroCoinFeesReq=[0uatom], and nonZeroCoinFeesReq=[1photon, 1stake]  split the paid fees:  if paidFee=[1uatom, 0.5photon], the splitCoinsByDenoms splits the paidFee into feeCoinsZeroDenom=[1uatom] (the same denom as zero coins in combinedFeeRequirement), and feeCoinsNonZeroDenom=[0.5stake]then feeCoinsZeroDenom=[1uatom] is checked by nonZeroCoinFeesReq=[1photon, 1stake].  Please note that feeCoins does not contain zero coins. The fee coins are split according to the denoms in zeroCoinFeesDenomReq or nonZeroCoinFeesDenomReq. If feeCoins contains coins not in both zeroCoinFeesDenomReq and nonZeroCoinFeesDenomReq, the transaction should be rejected. On the contrary, if feeCoins' denoms are in either zeroCoinFeesDenomReq or nonZeroCoinFeesDenomReq, and len(zeroCoinFeesDenomReq)!=0, the transaction can directly pass, otherwise, the fee amount need to be checked.

In CheckTx, fee is checked by the CombinedFeeRequirement(globalFees, localFees), which considers both minimum-gas-prices from config/app.toml and MinimumGasPricesParam from the globalfee Params (For more details, see globalfee). CombinedFeeRequirement contains non-deterministic part: minimum-gas-prices from app.toml. Therefore, CombinedFeeRequirement cannot be used in DeliverTx. In DeliverTx, only MinimumGasPricesParam in globalfee Params is used for fee verification. The code implementation is shown below.  func (mfd FeeDecorator) GetTxFeeRequired(ctx sdk.Context, tx sdk.FeeTx) (sdk.Coins, error) { // Get required global fee min gas prices // Note that it should never be empty since its default value is set to coin={&quot;StakingBondDenom&quot;, 0} globalFees, err := mfd.GetGlobalFee(ctx, tx) if err != nil { return sdk.Coins{}, err } // In DeliverTx, the global fee min gas prices are the only tx fee requirements. if !ctx.IsCheckTx() { return globalFees, nil } // In CheckTx mode, the local and global fee min gas prices are combined // to form the tx fee requirements // Get local minimum-gas-prices localFees := GetMinGasPrice(ctx, int64(tx.GetGas())) // Return combined fee requirements return CombinedFeeRequirement(globalFees, localFees) }   Deterministic Bypass Parameters: The decision of whether a message can bypass the minimum fee has to be deterministic as well.

Module Initialization Order: The genutils module must be initialized before the globalfee module. This is due to the DeliverGenTxs in the genutils module, is called during initGenesis. This function executes DeliverTx, which subsequently calls the AnteHandle in FeeDecorator, triggering the fee check in DeliverTx. To prevent the DeliverGenTxs go through a fee check, the initialization of the globalfee module should occur after the genutils module. This sequencing ensures that all necessary components are in place when the fee check occurs. See Gaia Issue #2489 for more context.

Indeed, validators are not chosen based on their self-delegated stake but based on their total stake, which is the sum of their self-delegated stake and of the stake that is delegated to them. This is an important property, as it makes delegators a safeguard against validators that exhibit bad behavior. If a validator misbehaves, their delegators will move their Atoms away from them, thereby reducing their stake. Eventually, if a validator's stake falls under the top 180 addresses with highest stake, they will exit the validator set.  Delegators share the revenue of their validators, but they also share the risks. In terms of revenue, validators and delegators differ in that validators can apply a commission on the revenue that goes to their delegator before it is distributed. This commission is known to delegators beforehand and can only change according to predefined constraints (see section below). In terms of risk, delegators' Atoms can be slashed if their validator misbehaves. For more, see Risks section.  To become delegators, Atom holders need to send a &quot;Delegate transaction&quot; where they specify how many Atoms they want to bond and to which validator. A list of validator candidates will be displayed in Cosmos Hub explorers. Later, if a delegator wants to unbond part or all of their stake, they need to send an &quot;Unbond transaction&quot;. From there, the delegator will have to wait 3 weeks to retrieve their Atoms. Delegators can also send a &quot;Rebond Transaction&quot; to switch from one validator to another, without having to go through the 3 weeks waiting period.

Here are the main directives of a delegator:  Perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating. If a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake, which includes the stake of their delegators, can be slashed. Delegators should therefore carefully select validators they think will behave correctly.Actively monitor their validator after having delegated. Delegators should ensure that the validators they delegate to behave correctly, meaning that they have good uptime, do not double sign or get compromised, and participate in governance. They should also monitor the commission rate that is applied. If a delegator is not satisfied with its validator, they can unbond or switch to another validator (Note: Delegators do not have to wait for the unbonding period to switch validators. Rebonding takes effect immediately).Participate in governance. Delegators can and are expected to actively participate in governance. A delegator's voting power is proportional to the size of their bonded stake. If a delegator does not vote, they will inherit the vote of their validator(s). If they do vote, they override the vote of their validator(s). Delegators therefore act as a counterbalance to their validators.

This revenue is given in three forms:  Block provisions (Atoms): They are paid in newly created Atoms. Block provisions exist to incentivize Atom holders to stake. The yearly inflation rate is calculated to target 2/3 bonded stake. If the total bonded stake in the network is less than 2/3 of the total Atom supply, inflation increases until it reaches 20%. If the total bonded stake is more than 2/3 of the Atom supply, inflation decreases until it reaches 7%. This means that if total bonded stake stays less than 2/3 of the total Atom supply for a prolonged period of time, unbonded Atom holders can expect their Atom value to deflate by 20% (compounded) per year.Transaction fees (various tokens): Each transfer on the Cosmos Hub comes with transactions fees. These fees can be paid in any currency that is whitelisted by the Hub's governance. Fees are distributed to bonded Atom holders in proportion to their stake.

Before this revenue is distributed to delegators, the validator can apply a commission. In other words, delegators have to pay a commission to their validators on the revenue they earn. Let us look at a concrete example:  We consider a validator whose stake (i.e. self-delegated stake + delegated stake) is 10% of the total stake of all validators. This validator has 20% self-delegated stake and applies a commission of 10%. Now let us consider a block with the following revenue:  990 Atoms in block provisions10 Atoms in transaction fees.  This amounts to a total of 1000 Atoms and 100 Photons to be distributed among all staking pools.  Our validator's staking pool represents 10% of the total stake, which means the pool obtains 100 Atoms and 10 Photons. Now let us look at the internal distribution of revenue:  Commission = 10% * 80% * 100 Atoms = 8 AtomsValidator's revenue = 20% * 100 Atoms + Commission = 28 AtomsDelegators' total revenue = 80% * 100 Atoms - Commission = 72 Atoms  Then, each delegator in the staking pool can claim their portion of the delegators' total revenue.

The LSM mitigates liquid staking risks by limiting the total amount of ATOM that can be liquid staked to a percentage of all staked ATOM. As an additional risk-mitigation feature, the LSM introduces a requirement that validators self-bond ATOM to be eligible for delegations from liquid staking providers or to be eligible to mint LSM tokens. This mechanism is called the “validator bond”, and is technically distinct from the current self-bond mechanism, but functions similarly.  At the same time, the LSM introduces the ability for staked ATOM to be instantly liquid staked, without having to wait for the unbonding period.  The LSM enables users to instantly liquid stake their staked ATOM, without having to wait the twenty-one day unbonding period. This is important, because a very large portion of the ATOM supply is currently staked. Liquid staking ATOM that is already staked incurs a switching cost in the form of three weeks’ forfeited staking rewards. The LSM eliminates this switching cost.  A user would be able to visit any liquid staking provider that has integrated with the LSM and click a button to convert her staked ATOM to liquid staked ATOM. It would be as easy as liquid staking unstaked ATOM.  Technically speaking, this is accomplished by using something called an “LSM share.” Using the liquid staking module, a user can tokenize their staked ATOM and turn it into LSM shares. LSM shares can be redeemed for underlying staked tokens and are transferable. After staked ATOM is tokenized it can be immediately transferred to a liquid staking provider in exchange for liquid staking tokens - without having to wait for the unbonding period.  ","version":"Latest","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Toggling the ability to tokenize shares​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Delegator FAQ","url":"/main/delegators/delegator-faq#toggling-the-ability-to-tokenize-shares","content":" Currently the liquid staking module facilitates the immediate conversion of staked assets into liquid staked tokens. Despite the many benefits that come with this capability, it does inadvertently negate a protective measure available via traditional staking, where an account can stake their tokens to render them illiquid in the event that their wallet is compromised (the attacker would first need to unbond, then transfer out the tokens).  Tokenization obviates this potential recovery measure, as an attacker could tokenize and immediately transfer staked tokens to another wallet. So, as an additional protective measure, the staking module permit accounts to selectively disable the tokenization of their stake with the DisableTokenizeShares message.  The DisableTokenizeShares message is exposed by the staking module and can be executed as follows:  gaiad tx staking disable-tokenize-shares --from mykey   When tokenization is disabled, a lock is placed on the account, effectively preventing the tokenization of any delegations. Re-enabling tokenization would initiate the removal of the lock, but the process is not immediate. The lock removal is queued, with the lock itself persisting throughout the unbonding period. Following the completion of the unbonding period, the lock would be completely removed, restoring the account's ability to tokenize. For liquid staking protocols that enable the lock, this delay better positions the base layer to coordinate a recovery in the event of an exploit.

First, staked Atoms are locked up, and retrieving them requires a 3 week waiting period called unbonding period. Additionally, if a validator misbehaves, a portion of their total stake can be slashed (i.e. destroyed). This includes the stake of their delegators.  There is one main slashing condition:  Double signing: If someone reports on that a validator signed two different blocks with the same chain ID at the same height, this validator will get slashed.  This is why Atom holders should perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating. It is also important that delegators actively monitor the activity of their validators. If a validator behaves suspiciously or is too often offline, delegators can choose to unbond from them or switch to another validator. Delegators can also mitigate risk by distributing their stake across multiple validators.

The degree to which you engage with the Cosmos Hub community should be relative to the potential impact that your proposal may have on the stakeholders. This guide does not cover all ways of engaging but here are some suggestions:  Post your idea to the Cosmos Hub Forum  Mention the idea in a community call (often hosted on Twitter)Host an AMA on Reddit  We encourage you to experiment and use your strengths to introduce proposal ideas and gather feedback.  There are many different ways to engage. One strategy involves a few stages of engagement before and after submitting a proposal on chain.  Why do it in stages? It's a more conservative approach to save resources. The idea is to check in with key stakeholders at each stage before investing more resources into developing your proposal.  In the first stage of this strategy, you should engage people (ideally experts) informally about your idea. You'll want to start with the minimal, critical components (name, value to Cosmos Hub, timeline, any funding needs) and check:  Does it make sense?Are there critical flaws?How will this affect other projects or properties of the Hub?  You should be engaging with key stakeholders (e.g., a large validator operator) with a few short sentences to measure their support. Here's an example:  &quot;We are considering a proposal for funding to work on project. We think it will help the Hub to outcome. Timeline is x, and we're asking for y amount. Do you think that this is a proposal that large validator may support?&quot;  Why a large validator? They tend to be the de facto decision-makers on the Cosmos Hub, since their delegators also delegate their voting power. If you can establish a base layer of off-chain support, you can be more confident that it's worth proceeding to the next stage.  Note: Many validators will likely hesitate to commit support, and that's okay. It will be important to reassure these stakeholders that this isn't a binding commitment. You're just canvasing the community to get a feel for whether it's worthwhile to proceed. It's also an opportunity to connect with new people and to answer their questions about what it is you're working on. It will be important for them to clearly understand why you think what you're proposing will be valuable to the Cosmos Hub, and if possible, why it will be valuable to them as long-term stakeholders.  If you're already confident about your idea, skip to Stage 2.

Governance proposals potentially impact many stakeholders. Introduce your idea with known members of the community before investing resources into drafting a proposal. Don't let negative feedback dissuade you from exploring your idea if you think that it's still important.  If you know people who are very involved with the Cosmos Hub, send them a private message with a concise overview of what you think will result from your idea or proposed changes.

However, remember that the largest ATOM stakers have the biggest vote, so a vocal minority isn't necessarily representative or predictive of the outcome of an on-chain vote.  You could choose to take a conservative approach and wait until you have some confidence that you roughly have initial support from a majority of the voting power before proceeding to drafting the details of your proposal.

You'll want to be concise so that people can assess your proposal quickly. You'll want to be detailed so that voters will have a clear, meaningful understanding of what the changes are and how they are likely to be impacted.  Each major proposal type has a rough template available on the forum: Text, community pool spend, parameter change, software upgrade.  Each proposal should contain a summary with key details about what the proposal hopes to change. If you were viewing only the summary with no other context, it should be a good start to being able to make a decision.  Assume that many people will stop reading at this point. However it is important to provide in-depth information. The on-chain proposal text should also include a link to an un-editable version of the text, such as an IPFS pin, and a link to where discussion about the idea is happening.  A few more pointers for Parameter-change and Community Spend proposals are below.  Parameter-Change​  An example of a successful parameter change proposal is Proposal #66. Note that this proposal went on-chain without the recommended IPFS pin.  Problem/Value - The problem or value that's motivating the parameter change(s).Solution - How changing the parameter(s) will address the problem or improve the network.Risks &amp; Benefits - How making this/these change(s) may expose stakeholders to new benefits and/or risks. The beneficiaries of the change(s) (ie. who will these changes impact and how?)Voters should understand the importance of the change(s) in a simple way Supplementary materials - Optional materials eg. models, graphs, tables, research, signed petition, etc  Community-Spend Proposal​  An example of a successful community spend proposal is Proposal #63.  Applicant(s) - The profile of the person(s)/entity making the proposal. Who you are and your involvement in Cosmos and/or other blockchain networks.An overview of team members involved and their relevant experience. Problem - What you're solving and/or opportunity you're addressing. Past, present (and possibly a prediction of the future without this work being done). Solution - How you're proposing to deliver the solution. Your plan to fix the problem or deliver value.The beneficiaries of this plan (ie. who will your plan impact and how?).Your reasons for selecting this plan.Your motivation for delivering this solution/value. Funding - amount and denomination proposed eg. 5000 ATOM. The entity controlling the account receiving the funding.Consider an itemized breakdown of funding per major deliverable.Note that the 'budget' of a spend proposal is generally the easiest thing to criticize. If your budget is vague, consider explaining the reasons you're unable to give a detailed breakdown and be clear about what happens if you do not meet your budget. Deliverables and timeline - the specifics of what you're delivering and how, and what to expect. What are the specific deliverables? (be detailed).When will each of these be delivered?How will each of these be delivered?What will happen if you do not deliver on time?Do you have a plan to return the funds if you're under-budget or the project fails?How will you be accountable to the Cosmos Hub stakeholders? How will you communicate updates and how often?How can the community observe your progress?How can the community provide feedback? How should the quality of deliverables be assessed? eg. metrics.

Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups. Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission. https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum. It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”. A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful.&quot;, &quot;deposit&quot;: &quot;100000uatom&quot;, &quot;metadata&quot;: &quot;ipfs://CID&quot;, }   ","version":"Latest","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Community Pool Spend​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Formatting a Proposal","url":"/main/governance/formatting#community-pool-spend","content":" There are five (5) components:  Title - the distinguishing name of the proposal, typically the way that explorers list proposalsSummary - the body of the proposal that further describes what is being proposed and details surrounding the proposalRecipient - the Cosmos Hub (bech32-based) address that will receive funding from the Community PoolAmount - the amount of funding that the recipient will receive in micro-ATOMs (uatom)Deposit - the amount that will be contributed to the deposit (in micro-ATOMs &quot;uatom&quot;) from the account submitting the proposal  If the description says that a certain address will receive a certain number of ATOMs, it should also be programmed to do that, but it's possible that that's not the case (accidentally or otherwise).

It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.\\n\\nThe requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:\\n\\n* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.\\n* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.\\n* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.\\n* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.\\nThe work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of [Hypha Worker Co-op](https://hypha.coop/) and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.\\n## Multisig Members\\n* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)\\n* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)\\n* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)\\n\\nWe feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).\\n## Timeline and Deliverables\\nWe estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:\\n* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.\\n* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.\\n* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.\\n* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.\\n* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.\\n* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.\\n\\nAt the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.\\n\\nFor more context, you can read through the discussions on this [proposal on the Discourse forum](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833).\\n\\n## Governance Votes\\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\\n**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 1000 ATOM to a multisig that will spend them to improve governance discussions in the Discourse forum.\\n**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).\\n**NO WITH VETO** - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.\\n**ABSTAIN** - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\\n## Recipient\\ncosmos1xf2qwf6g6xvuttpf37xwrgp08qq984244952ze\\n## Amount\\n1000 ATOM\\n\\n***Disclosure**: Hypha has an existing contract with the Interchain Foundation focused on the testnet program and improving documentation.

The deposit need not be provided in its entirety by the submitter. If the initial proposer's deposit is not sufficient, the proposal enters the deposit_period status. Then, any Atom holder can increase the deposit by sending a depositTx.  Once the deposit reaches minDeposit, the proposal enters the voting_period, which lasts 2 weeks. Any bonded Atom holder can then cast a vote on this proposal. The options are Yes, No, NoWithVeto and Abstain. The weight of the vote is based on the amount of bonded Atoms of the sender. If they don't vote, delegator inherit the vote of their validator. However, delegators can override their validator's vote by sending a vote themselves.

Besides the time it takes to push your proposal on-chain, the only other limiting factor is a fixed 14-day voting period. As soon as the proposal passes, your account will be credited the full amount of your proposal request.  To build rapport. Engaging publicly with the community is the opportunity to develop relationships with stakeholders and to educate them about the importance of your work.

Hence, detailed documentation about a proposal is usually hosted on a separate censorship resistant data-hosting platform, like IPFS.  Once you have drafted your proposal, ideally as a Markdown file, you can upload it to the IPFS network:  By running an IPFS node and the IPFS software, orBy using a service such as https://pinata.cloud  Ensure that you &quot;pin&quot; the file so that it continues to be available on the network. You should get a URL like this: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbkQNtCAdR1CNbFE8ujub2jcpwUcmSRpSCg8gVWrTHSWD  The value QmbkQNtCAdR1CNbFE8ujub2jcpwUcmSRpSCg8gVWrTHSWD is called the CID of your file - it is effectively the file's hash.  If you uploaded a markdown file, you can use the IPFS markdown viewer to render the document for better viewing. Links for the markdown viewer look like https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkzDwWqPbnAh5YiV5VwcTLnGdwSNsNTn2aDxdXBFca7D/example#/ipfs/&lt;CID&gt;, where &lt;CID&gt; is your CID.

The reason we use IPFS is that it is a decentralized means of storage, making it resistant to censorship or single points of failure.

For instance, a validator key needs to be set up before running the blockchain node, so that blocks can be correctly signed. The private key can be stored in different locations, called &quot;backends&quot;, such as a file or the operating system's own key storage.  Headless environments are recommended to use either the file or pass backends. More information is available at the SDK documentation page.

If you are migrating from an old version of gaiad you will need to migrate your old keys into your operating system's credentials storage by running the following command:  gaiad keys migrate   The command will prompt for every passphrase. If a passphrase is incorrect, it will skip the respective key.  Generate Keys​  You'll need an account private and public key pair (a.k.a. sk, pk respectively) to be able to receive funds, send txs, bond tx, etc.  To generate a new secp256k1 key:  gaiad keys add &lt;account_name&gt;   The output of the above command will contain a seed phrase. It is recommended to save the seed phrase in a safe place so that in case you forget the password of the operating system's credentials store, you could eventually regenerate the key from the seed phrase with the following command:  gaiad keys add --recover   If you check your private keys, you'll now see &lt;account_name&gt;:  gaiad keys show &lt;account_name&gt;   View the validator operator's address via:  gaiad keys show &lt;account_name&gt; --bech=val   You can see all your available keys by typing:  gaiad keys list   View the validator pubkey for your node by typing:  gaiad tendermint show-validator   Note that this is the Tendermint signing key, not the operator key you will use in delegation transactions.  We strongly recommend NOT using the same passphrase for multiple keys. The CometBFT team and the Interchain Foundation will not be responsible for the loss of funds.  Generate Multisig Public Keys​  You can generate and print a multisig public key by typing:  gaiad keys add --multisig=name1,name2,name3[...] --multisig-threshold=K new_key_name   K is the minimum number of private keys that must have signed the transactions that carry the public key's address as signer.  The --multisig flag must contain the name of public keys that will be combined into a public key that will be generated and stored as new_key_name in the local database. All names supplied through --multisig must already exist in the local database. Unless the flag --nosort is set, the order in which the keys are supplied on the command line does not matter, i.e. the following commands generate two identical keys:  gaiad keys add --multisig=foo,bar,baz --multisig-threshold=2 multisig_address gaiad keys add --multisig=baz,foo,bar --multisig-threshold=2 multisig_address   Multisig addresses can also be generated on-the-fly and printed through the which command:  gaiad keys show --multisig-threshold K name1 name2 name3 [...]   For more information regarding how to generate, sign and broadcast transactions with a multi signature account see Multisig Transactions.

It is important to note that the block mode should not be used in most circumstances. This is because broadcasting can timeout but the tx may still be included in a block.

Create a Governance Proposal​  In order to create a governance proposal, you must submit an initial deposit along with a title and description. Various modules outside of governance may implement their own proposal types and handlers (eg. parameter changes), where the governance module itself supports Text proposals. Any module outside of governance has its command mounted on top of submit-proposal.  To submit a Text proposal:  gaiad tx gov submit-proposal \\ --title=&lt;title&gt; \\ --description=&lt;description&gt; \\ --type=&quot;Text&quot; \\ --deposit=&quot;1000000uatom&quot; \\ --from=&lt;name&gt; \\ --chain-id=&lt;chain_id&gt;   You may also provide the proposal directly through the --proposal flag which points to a JSON file containing the proposal.  To submit a parameter change proposal, you must provide a proposal file as its contents are less friendly to CLI input:  gaiad tx gov submit-proposal param-change &lt;path/to/proposal.json&gt; \\ --from=&lt;name&gt; \\ --chain-id=&lt;chain_id&gt;   Where proposal.json contains the following:  { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Param Change&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Update max validators&quot;, &quot;changes&quot;: [ { &quot;subspace&quot;: &quot;staking&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;MaxValidators&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 105 } ], &quot;deposit&quot;: [ { &quot;denom&quot;: &quot;stake&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;: &quot;10000000&quot; } ] }   Currently parameter changes are evaluated but not validated, so it is very important that any value change is valid (ie. correct type and within bounds) for its respective parameter, eg. MaxValidators should be an integer and not a decimal. Proper vetting of a parameter change proposal should prevent this from happening (no deposits should occur during the governance process), but it should be noted regardless.  The SoftwareUpgrade is currently not supported as it's not implemented and currently does not differ from the semantics of a Text proposal.  Query Proposals​  Once created, you can now query information of the proposal:  gaiad query gov proposal &lt;proposal_id&gt;   Or query all available proposals:  gaiad query gov proposals   You can also query proposals filtered by voter or depositor by using the corresponding flags.  To query for the proposer of a given governance proposal:  gaiad query gov proposer &lt;proposal_id&gt;   Increase Deposit​  In order for a proposal to be broadcasted to the network, the amount deposited must be above a minDeposit value (initial value: 512000000uatom). If the proposal you previously created didn't meet this requirement, you can still increase the total amount deposited to activate it. Once the minimum deposit is reached, the proposal enters voting period:  gaiad tx gov deposit &lt;proposal_id&gt; &quot;10000000uatom&quot; \\ --from=&lt;name&gt; \\ --chain-id=&lt;chain_id&gt;   NOTE: Proposals that don't meet this requirement will be deleted after MaxDepositPeriod is reached.

Any the key holders can now generate the multisig transaction by combining the required signature files:  gaiad tx multisign \\ unsignedTx.json \\ p1p2p3 \\ p1signature.json p2signature.json &gt; signedTx.json   The transaction can now be sent to the node:  gaiad tx broadcast signedTx.json   ","version":"Latest","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Shells Completion Scripts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Interacting with Gaiad (CLI)","url":"/main/hub-tutorials/gaiad#shells-completion-scripts","content":" Completion scripts for popular UNIX shell interpreters such as Bash and Zshcan be generated through the completion command, which is available for bothgaiad and gaiad.

This fee pays for the gas required to run the transaction. The formula is the following:  fees = ceil(gas * gasPrices)   Gas is the smallest unit or pricing value required to perform a transaction. Different transactions require different amounts of gas. The gas amount for a transaction is calculated as it is being processed, but it can be estimated beforehand by using the auto value for the gas flag. The gas estimate can be adjusted with the flag --gas-adjustment (default 1.0) to ensure enough gas is provided for the transaction.  The gasPrice is the price of each unit of gas. Each validator sets a min-gas-price value, and will only include transactions that have a gasPrice greater than their min-gas-price.  The transaction fees are the product of gas and gasPrice. The higher the gasPrice/fees, the higher the chance that a transaction will get included in a block.  For mainnet, the recommended gas-prices is 0.0025uatom.  A full-node keeps unconfirmed transactions in its mempool. In order to protect it from spam, it is better to set a minimum-gas-prices that the transaction must meet in order to be accepted in the node's mempool.

For more information, see CometBFT's State Sync docs.  To enable state sync, visit an explorer to get a recent block height and corresponding hash. A node operator can choose any height/hash in the current bonding period, but as the recommended snapshot period is 1000 blocks, it is advised to choose something close to current height - 1000.  With the block height and hash selected, update the configuration in ~/.gaia/config/config.toml to set enable = true, and populate the trust_height and trust_hash. Node operators can configure the rpc servers to a preferred provider, but there must be at least two entries. It is important that these are two rpc servers the node operator trusts to verify component parts of the chain state. While not recommended, uniqueness is not currently enforced, so it is possible to duplicate the same server in the list and still sync successfully.  Note: In the future, the RPC server requirement will be deprecated as state sync is moved to the p2p layer in Tendermint 0.38.  ####################################################### ### State Sync Configuration Options ### ####################################################### [statesync] # State sync rapidly bootstraps a new node by discovering, fetching, and restoring a state machine # snapshot from peers instead of fetching and replaying historical blocks.

","version":"Latest","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"HD Wallets","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/main/resources/hd-wallets","content":"HD Wallets Accounts in Cosmos are Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets. Originally specified in Bitcoin's BIP32, HD wallets are a special kind of wallet that let users derive any number of accounts from a single seed. To understand what that means, let us first define some terminology: Wallet: Set of accounts obtained from a given seed.Account: A pair of public key/private key.Private Key: A private key is a secret piece of information used to sign messages. In the blockchain context, a private key identifies the owner of an account. The private key of a user should never be revealed to others.Public Key: A public key is a piece of information obtained by applying a one-way mathematical function on a private key. From it, an address can be derived. A private key cannot be found from a public key.Address: An address is a public string with a human-readable prefix that identifies an account. It is obtained by applying mathematical transformations to a public key.Digital Signature: A digital signature is a piece of cryptographic information that proves the owner of a given private key approved of a given message without revealing the private key.Seed: Same as Mnemonic.Mnemonic: A mnemonic is a sequence of words that is used as seed to derive private keys. The mnemonic is at the core of each wallet. NEVER LOSE YOUR MNEMONIC. WRITE IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND STORE IT SOMEWHERE SAFE. IF YOU LOSE IT, THERE IS NO WAY TO RETRIEVE IT. IF SOMEONE GAINS ACCESS TO IT, THEY GAIN ACCESS TO ALL THE ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTS. At the core of a HD wallet, there is a seed. From this seed, users can deterministically generate accounts. To generate an account from a seed, one-way mathematical transformations are applied. To decide which account to generate, the user specifies a path, generally an integer (0, 1, 2, ...). By specifying path to be 0 for example, the Wallet will generate Private Key 0 from the seed. Then, Public Key 0 can be generated from Private Key 0. Finally, Address 0 can be generated from Public Key 0. All these steps are one way only, meaning the Public Key cannot be found from the Address, the Private Key cannot be found from the Public Key, ... Account 0 Account 1 Account 2 +------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+ | | | | | | | Address 0 | | Address 1 | | Address 2 | | ^ | | ^ | | ^ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | + | | + | | + | | Public key 0 | | Public key 1 | | Public key 2 | | ^ | | ^ | | ^ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | + | | + | | + | | Private key 0 | | Private key 1 | | Private key 2 | | ^ | | ^ | | ^ | +------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+ | | | | | | | | | +--------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +---------+---------+ | | | Mnemonic (Seed) | | | +-------------------+ The process of derivating accounts from the seed is deterministic. This means that given the same path, the derived private key will always be the same. The funds stored in an account are controlled by the private key. This private key is generated using a one-way function from the mnemonic. If you lose the private key, you can retrieve it using the mnemonic. However, if you lose the mnemonic, you will lose access to all the derived private keys. Likewise, if someone gains access to your mnemonic, they gain access to all the associated accounts. danger Do not lose or share your 24 words with anyone. To prevent theft or loss of funds, it is best to keep multiple copies of your mnemonic stored in safe, secure places. If someone is able to gain access to your mnemonic, they will fully control the accounts associated with them.","keywords":"","version":"Latest"},{"title":"Cosmos Hub Archives","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/main/resources/archives","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Latest"},{"title":"Big Dipper​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Cosmos Hub Archives","url":"/main/resources/archives#big-dipper","content":" Cosmos Hub 1Cosmos Hub 2Cosmos Hub 3  If you want to make archives available to the community, feel free to open a PR to this file and add them.

These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.  Validator candidates can bond their own ATOM and have ATOM &quot;delegated&quot;, or staked, to them by token holders. The Cosmos Hub has 180 active validators, but over time the number of validators can be changed through governance (MaxValidators parameter). Validator voting power is determined by the total number of ATOM tokens delegated to them. Validators that do not have enough voting power to be in the top 180 are considered inactive. Inactive validators can become active if their staked amount increases so that they fall into the top 180 validators.  Validators and their delegators earn ATOM as block provisions and tokens as transaction fees through execution of the Tendermint consensus protocol. Note that validators can set a commission percentage on the fees their delegators receive as additional incentive. You can find an overview of all current validators and their voting power on Mintscan.  If validators double sign or are offline for an extended period, their staked ATOM (including ATOM of users that delegated to them) can be slashed. The penalty depends on the severity of the violation.

One recommended way to mitigate these risks is for validators to carefully structure their network topology in a so-called sentry node architecture.  Validator nodes should only connect to full-nodes they trust because they operate them themselves or are run by other validators they know socially. A validator node will typically run in a data center. Most data centers provide direct links to the networks of major cloud providers. The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the cloud. This shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator's node directly to its sentry nodes, and may require new sentry nodes be spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.  Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses. Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet based attack cannot disturb them directly. This will ensure validator block proposals and votes always make it to the rest of the network.  To setup your sentry node architecture you can follow the instructions below:  Validators nodes should edit their config.toml:  # Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to # Do not add private peers to this list if you don't want them advertised persistent_peers =[list of sentry nodes] # Set true to enable the peer-exchange reactor pex = false   Sentry Nodes should edit their config.toml:  # Comma separated list of peer IDs to keep private (will not be gossiped to other peers) # Example ID: 3e16af0cead27979e1fc3dac57d03df3c7a77acc@3.87.179.235:26656 private_peer_ids = &quot;node_ids_of_private_peers&quot;   ","version":"Latest","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Environment Variables​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Validator Security","url":"/main/validators/security#environment-variables","content":" By default, uppercase environment variables with the following prefixes will replace lowercase command-line flags:  GA (for Gaia flags)TM (for Tendermint/CometBFT flags)BC (for democli or basecli flags)  For example, the environment variable GA_CHAIN_ID will map to the command line flag --chain-id.

Any user in the system can declare their intention to become a validator by sending a create-validator transaction to become validator candidates.

Validators can decide to run either a full node or a pruned node, but they need to make sure they retain enough blocks to be able to validate new blocks.

Because delegators share revenue with their validators, they also share risks. If a validator misbehaves, each of their delegators are partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stake. This penalty is one of the reasons why delegators must perform due diligence on validators before delegating. Spreading their stake over multiple validators is another layer of protection.

Larger validators also decrease the decentralization of the network, so delegators are suggested to consider delegating to smaller validators.Commission rate: Commission applied on revenue by validators before the revenue is distributed to their delegators.Track record: Delegators review the track record of the validators they plan to delegate to. This track record includes past votes on proposals and historical average uptime.Community contributions: Another (more subjective) criteria is the work that validators have contributed to the community, such as educational content, participation in the community channels, contributions to open source software, etc.  Apart from these criteria, validators send a create-validator transaction to signal a website address to complete their resume. Validators must build reputation one way or another to attract delegators. For example, a good practice for validators is to have a third party audit their setup.

","version":"Latest","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"How are fees distributed?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Validator FAQ","url":"/main/validators/validator-faq#how-are-fees-distributed","content":" Fees are similarly distributed with the exception that the block proposer can get a bonus on the fees of the block they propose if the proposer includes more than the strict minimum of required precommits.  When a validator is selected to propose the next block, the validator must include at least 2/3 precommits of the previous block. However, an incentive to include more than 2/3 precommits is a bonus. The bonus is linear: it ranges from 1% if the proposer includes 2/3rd precommits (minimum for the block to be valid) to 5% if the proposer includes 100% precommits. Of course the proposer must not wait too long or other validators may timeout and move on to the next proposer. As such, validators have to find a balance between wait-time to get the most signatures and risk of losing out on proposing the next block. This mechanism aims to incentivize non-empty block proposals, better networking between validators, and mitigates censorship.  For a concrete example to illustrate the aforementioned concept, there are 10 validators with equal stake. Each validator applies a 1% commission rate and has 20% of self-delegated ATOM. Now comes a successful block that collects a total of 1025.51020408 ATOM in fees.  First, a 2% tax is applied. The corresponding ATOM go to the reserve pool. The reserve pool's funds can be allocated through governance to fund bounties and upgrades.  2% * 1025.51020408 = 20.51020408 ATOM go to the reserve pool.  1005 ATOM now remain. For this example, the proposer included 100% of the signatures in its block so the proposer obtains the full bonus of 5%.  To solve this simple equation to find the reward R for each validator:  9*R + R + R*5% = 1005 ⇔ R = 1005/10.05 = 100  For the proposer validator: The pool obtains R + R * 5%: 105 ATOMCommission: 105 * 80% * 1% = 0.84 ATOMValidator's reward: 105 * 20% + Commission = 21.84 ATOMDelegators' rewards: 105 * 80% - Commission = 83.16 ATOM (each delegator is able to claim its portion of these rewards in proportion to their stake) For each non-proposer validator: The pool obtains R: 100 ATOMCommission: 100 * 80% * 1% = 0.8 ATOMValidator's reward: 100 * 20% + Commission = 20.8 ATOMDelegators' rewards: 100 * 80% - Commission = 79.2 ATOM (each delegator is able to claim their portion of these rewards in proportion to their stake)  ","version":"Latest","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"What are the slashing conditions?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Validator FAQ","url":"/main/validators/validator-faq#what-are-the-slashing-conditions","content":" If a validator misbehaves, their delegated stake is partially slashed.

An attacker scans the network, tries to learn the IP address of various validator nodes, and disconnects them from communication by flooding them with traffic.  One recommended way to mitigate these risks is for validators to carefully structure their network topology using a sentry node architecture.  Validator nodes are expected to connect only to full nodes they trust because they operate the full nodes themselves or the trust full nodes are run by other validators they know socially. A validator node is typically run in a data center. Most data centers provide direct links to the networks of major cloud providers. The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the cloud. This mitigation shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator's node directly to its sentry nodes, and can require that new sentry nodes are spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.  Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses. Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet-based attack cannot disturb them directly. This strategy ensures that validator block proposals and votes have a much higher chance to make it to the rest of the network.  For more sentry node details, see the CometBFT Documentation or the Sentry Node Architecture Overview on the forum.
