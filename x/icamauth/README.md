# ICAMauth module

Interchain accounts message authentication module (ICAMauth module) is implemented according to the [interchain-accounts-demo](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-accounts-demo) repository with some refactoring. Some minor modifications have been made, most notably renaming `intertx` to `icamauth`. All credit  and thanks go to the original authors.
